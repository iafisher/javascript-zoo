The backend uses the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework for Python. All the JavaScript implementations use the same backend API endpoints.

Most of the backend code is in the `api` app, which contains the API endpoints and the database models. The `ui` app serves the HTML. The `zoosite` directory contains backend-wide configuration.
