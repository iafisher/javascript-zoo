The same JavaScript application, implemented identically using three different popular JavaScript frameworks, plus one implementation in plain JavaScript.

The goal: a showcase of a small that demonstrates each framework's strengths, weaknesses, and quirks.

Written by yours truly and [Noah Kim](https://github.com/noahdkim).


## The frameworks
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): One of the oldest and most popular UI frameworks for JavaScript.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/): A newer, smaller, simpler competitor to React.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): A framework that uses a compilation step to make DOM updates more efficient.
- Plain JavaScript: The base line of comparison. If it's simple enough to do in plain JS, why bother with a framework?


## The application
The application we are implementing is a fancy to-do list / task manager that lets you nest subtasks inside of tasks in a tree structure. You can organize your tasks into projects, edit your task and project descriptions using Markdown, choose a variety of statuses for your tasks (pending, completed, blocked, non-blocking, etc.), and see a chronological log of all actions you took on a project.
